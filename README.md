# ClawBot
This robot used Meccano servos attached to an Arduino with a Bluetooth shield. The Bluetooth shield would sync with my phone and transmit data to the servos so that they would mirror the orientation of my phone. This project included <i>Meccano</i> servos, <i>OneShield</i> Bluetooth Shield, and the <i>Arduino</i> Uno.
